# Twenty Five Days of DAX

## Description
This repo contains my work for the competition 25 Days of DAX hosted by [Curbal](https://curbal.com/25-days-of-dax-fridays-challenge-ed2-world-cup-data).

## Description



* Ruth (owner of Curbal) did a great job. These were fantastic problems.
* The problems were focused on creating cards.
* There was no use of Power Query or any graphics.
* You can follow Ruth on Twitter at [Ruth Pozuelo Mtnez](https://twitter.com/ruthpozuelo])
## Requirements and Dependencies

Purely a Power BI project.

## Install and Run Project

Nothing special. Vanilla Power BI.

## Technologies

Focus on DAX.

# Links and Documentation

The work consists of 25 problems focused on using DAX to explore the World Cup database kept [here](https://github.com/jfjelstul/worldcup).

## Go Forward

* This might be a great dataset to use for some graphics practice.
* I need to see if there is some equivalent for American football.
* I would be interested in creating something of use for WW2 students that would provide similar practice.
